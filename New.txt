the images we are getting now are very low quality. The program is working perfectly as 
it should. If you want to use the latest picture everytime then you need to

make sure that

The new picture is Very clear. and in day light

Ideally it should be only balck and white...any other colors will confuse Tesseract.

This is how your pictures should look for Tesseract.

If the picture is not clear...Tesseract will not work and it will crash the program..

So make sure you test using a few pictures with laptop connected to make sure it is working

This problem is only because of Tesseract and beyond my control. so you have to be careful


Now if you want to use latest pictures, you need to make this change in the code. Just 
copy the complete green color text infront of camera into the filename. 

UNDERSTAND???

These are three different functions...We are doing the OCR on the main processor
and the Audio on a different thread to make it easy for RPi.

The first_iteration function runs the audio on a separate thread and make the 
program ready to speak

then we wait 2 seconds 

and then the continuous(text) function plays the audio
